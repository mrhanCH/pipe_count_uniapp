### Congratulations to this project for winning the second place in the International OpenCV 2022 Competition Team Award! ! !
### Project team members: Mr. He + the author himself (AndyNet&&GreenOpen)

#### introduce
Steel pipe count DJANGO backend version, using django framework for development.

This project is only developed and debugged on the Windows system, please test the Linux and Mac systems by yourself.

The front-end is developed using the uniapp framework. This project needs to be used in conjunction with the author's front-end project, or you can build other front-ends yourself. Please see the introduction below for the open interface.

The onnx model is trained by YOLOV5_P6. The training set pictures used by the current model are all cross-sectional photos of steel pipes in different environments. Due to the limited training set, the mAP of the current model is about 0.5-0.6.

Thanks to Mr. Helu for his professional guidance throughout!
